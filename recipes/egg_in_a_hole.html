    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Classic egg in a hole is made inside a waffle for a sweet, buttery flavor and added crunch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Waffle</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter). Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air fryer, along with the small center waffle. </li>
        <li>Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.</li>
